## Releasing [![Build](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/xdev-software/xapi-fx/Release?label=Release)](https://github.com/xdev-software/xapi-fx/actions/workflows/release.yml)
Consider doing a [test-deployment](https://github.com/xdev-software/xapi-fx/actions/workflows/test-deploy.yml?query=branch%3Adevelop) before actually releasing.

If the ``develop`` is ready for release, create a pull request to the ``master``-Branch and merge the changes.

When the release is finished do the following:
* Merge the auto-generated PR (with the incremented version number) back into the ``develop``
* Add the release notes to the [GitHub release](https://github.com/xdev-software/xapi-fx/releases/latest)
